JS/TS tools are slow. Let's play around with them.

Look I don't really know the point of this. It would be fun to implement some
juicy performance gains by moving code into Rust, etc.

I don't expect there to be any _real_ projects born out of this. If you are
here looking for something useful, please look elsewhere 👨‍💻.
